                            <h3>The importance of a modern educational system</h3>
			    <!--
                            <p>When you hear the word “education”, what comes to your mind? I can tell you what comes to my mind- notes desperately scribbled while trying to keep up with the teacher, not even understanding the lesson; hours spent completing
                                assignments; weeks spent worrying over tests or examinations. I am sure that the majority of you would think something similar . What about the word “science”? When I was younger, that word made me think of discovery, whether
                                it be of a new type of star, a new species, or a new technology; now, when I hear the word “science”, I still think of that, but now I mostly think of tests and assignments. What about the word “astronomy”? When I hear
                                that word, I think of this one quote by the astronomer and writer Carl Sagan:</p>
                            <p>“There is a place with four suns in the sky- red, white, blue, and yellow; two of them are so close that they touch, and star-stuff flows between them. I know of a world with a million moons. I know of a sun the size of Earth-
                                and made of diamond. There are atomic nuclei a few miles across which rotate thirty times a second… There are turbulent plasmas writhing with X- and gamma-rays and mighty stellar explosions. There are, perhaps, places which
                                are outside our universe. The universe is vast and awesome, and for the first time we are becoming a part of it.”</p>
                            <p>This quote is from Carl Sagan’s book Planetary Exploration, published 46 years ago, in 1970. However, 46 years after we knew about all of these wonders of the universe, there are still people- I am absolutely serious- who still
                                think the Earth is flat. More than two thousand years ago, the ancient Greek philosopher Eratosthenes was able to calculate the circumference of the Earth, with an astonishingly small error (which is impressive given the
                                technology of that time), but two thousand years afterwards, people still think the Earth is flat. This is proof of how badly our educational system is failing: how can people with high school diplomas, who have graduated
                                from high school, seriously believe that the Earth is flat?</p>
                            <p>This is proof that our school system fails to address the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) adequately. This is an especially pressing issue, because we are entering a new technological age, in
                                which technology is becoming more and more important each day. Technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and therefore, knowledge of science and technology is becoming increasingly important. However, our educational
                                system is failing to keep up: the mandatory science and mathematics courses (only up to Grade 11 for mathematics and Grade 10 for science) hardly brush the basics of those fields; technology courses are absolutely optional.
                                Even as computers are becoming more and more prevalent in everyday life, few people are capable of using them effectively (if you doubt this, ask any Tech Support professional), and fewer people still know how to program
                                computers, which is necessary to use them to their maximum capability. As Carl Sagan said, “We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology”.
                                Case in point- genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many people are afraid of them or perceive them as harmful; however, not one scientific study has shown any harm or risks whatsoever related
                                to genetic engineering (at least not one that hasn’t been retracted). If people were more educated about science, and more specifically, biology and biological engineering, then GMOs would be more accepted by governments,
                                which would lead to tremendous increases in agricultural efficiency, which, in turn, would allow a dramatic decrease in world hunger rates. However, this is being prevented by our inadequate science curricula, and the general
                                ineffectiveness of our scientific and technological education. Nonetheless, a strong understanding of mathematics is essential for science and technology; however, our mathematics curricula are in drastic need of repair-
                                in Grade 6, our teacher literally spent an entire month on multiplication tables, which would be really funny if it were not tragic. Mathematics is being dealt an injustice by our educational system. Even the Grade 11 high
                                school mathematics curriculum does not teach advanced-enough mathematics to understand the concepts taught in the Grade 11 physics curriculum, which really makes one wonder about the state of mathematics education in our
                                school system. It is obvious that there is a very pressing need to improve the educational system’s mathematics and science curricula. If the students of today are to become the scientists, researchers, and engineers of
                                tomorrow, then we must prepare them to take on these roles by providing them with the education which they need to become the technological leaders of the future.</p>
                            <p>However, this is not to say that the educational system should spend any less time or effort on the arts, especially music. The beneficial effects of music on the mind are hard to overstate; many scientific studies have confirmed
                                that learning to play a musical instrument helps learning and development in a variety of different ways, and overwhelming scientific consensus affirms these beneficial effects. However, our educational system is devoting
                                very little teaching effort or funds towards musical education, especially in the earlier grades, where music education is the most effective. Although it is understandable that quality musical education is expensive, it
                                is definitely worth the effort and financial resources. This also leads into another severe problem- our educational system is miserably underfunded. I am confident that every one of you understands how important education
                                is- without high-quality education, we, as a society, will go nowhere. Yet, our governments have historically been reluctant to spend very much resources on education. Especially now, as the importance of education is greater
                                than ever before, it is time for governments to realize the importance of education, and to devote to it the financial funding and governmental attention that it deserves.</p>
                            <p>Also, we must not forget the humanities, especially history. Our history curriculum is very poor, especially in high school, where there is only one mandatory history course, and it is very narrow- it only covers Canadian history.
                                It is shocking how few people have an adequate grasp of history, especially since history is essential for humanity: we must remember our mistakes, so that we can learn from them, and not repeat these mistakes in the future.
                                This was summarized very eloquently- and this is a very famous quote- “those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it”. This quote, contrary to popular belief, was not actually said by Winston Churchill; it was written
                                by George Santayana, an American philosopher, in his book The Life of Reason, published in five volumes from 1905 to 1906. I know this because I did research on this topic, and this illustrates another major failing of
                                the educational system: it does not teach students rational thinking and skepticism adequately.
                            </p>
                            <p>In this age of technology, where it is possible to instantly communicate with anyone anywhere on the globe, we are constantly barraged with information of all different natures. This has not only made it much easier to provide
                                information to a large number of people at the same time, but it has also made it easier to lie to and to deceive a large number of people at the same time. People can use social media to spread lies and deception for their
                                own benefit: I was going to provide an example of this, but it seems President-Elect Donald Trump has already provided an example for me, and he was very successful in using lies to advance his own ends. However, Trump
                                is not the only one to deceive the masses for his own benefit, and sadly so- for another example, let us turn to Vani Hari, or as she calls herself, “The Food Babe”. One of her most well-known assertions- and I am not joking;
                                she actually said this- is that “there is simply no acceptable level of any chemical to ingest, ever”. Any of you who know anything at all about chemistry should immediately see what is so laughably wrong about this statement:
                                everything we eat consists of chemicals, from carbohydrates to proteins to flavour molecules, and, quite literally, everything in between. In the public eye, the word “chemical” has taken on a negative meaning- evoking
                                images of pollution or poison- but the real meaning of the word “chemical” is as neutral as can be; a chemical is simply a substance with a specific molecular composition. Again, this is further proof of how important education
                                is: Vani Hari is relying on her followers’ lack of knowledge to manipulate them for her own personal gains- she makes huge amounts of money off of the products she sells. This is a perfect example of fearmongering. However,
                                if our educational system taught science adequately, and taught rational skepticism, Vani Hari’s fearmongering campaign would be a complete failure: the public’s skepticism, combined with their knowledge of fundamental
                                chemistry, would then allow them to question her assertions, and to rightfully dismiss them as scientifically incorrect. This demonstrates how badly our school system is failing by not teaching adequately rational thinking,
                                scientific inquiry, and skepticism.</p>
                            <h3>Skepticism</h3>
                            <p>Now, when most of you hear the word “skepticism”, you immediately assume it means “doubt”, and you immediately see skepticism as negative and harmful. This could not be further from the truth- skepticism is a healthy and beneficial
                                form of doubt that consists of questioning assertions and refusing to accept statements as facts without proof. When someone told you that the quote “those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it” originated from Winston
                                Churchill, did you ask them for proof? Did you ask them where or when he said it? Did they even know where he said it? They did not, because nobody has ever found where Churchill said that quote- there is no evidence that
                                he said it. However, if you show healthy skepticism, you will not take my word for that- you will try to find where Churchill said that quote yourself, and you will not find anything anywhere. If you do find where he said
                                that quote- and I highly doubt you will- then I will stand corrected, which leads to another part of skepticism is the ability, and the willingness, to admit one’s mistakes and to correct them. Unfortunately, a surprising
                                number of people have a strange fear of being proven wrong; the reason for this is that in our society, making mistakes is seen as failure, and our educational system instills in students a very strong and very damaging
                                fear of failure, which leads into my second point.</p>
                            <p>Our educational system evokes in students a very harmful fear of failure. Now, this fear is harmful for a wide variety of reasons, the first of which- and arguably the one with which the average student is the most familiar-
                                is the terrible amount of stress it places upon students; I am sure that any student is able to relate to this, myself included. However, if you show healthy skepticism, you will not accept this empirical evidence as proof
                                of anything; instead, you will search for scientific studies that support- or refute- our assertion. I myself have found two such studies. The first one is a study conducted by New York University that surveyed 128 high-achieving
                                high school students in two private schools. The study found that 49% of these high-achieving students- almost half- reported feeling “a great deal of stress” every day; 26%- more than a quarter- showed clinically significant
                                symptoms of depression, which refer to symptoms of depression that noticeably and demonstrably affect one’s daily life. More than one in four high-achieving high school students experienced symptoms of depression severe
                                enough to affect their daily life. The worst part of this is that these are not the students that are struggling in school, and that are actually at risk of failure- these are high-achieving students, with an average GPA
                                of around 3.4 or 3.5. That is simply unacceptable. Another survey conducted by the American Psychological Association found that 36%- more than a third- of teenagers reported feeling exhaustion as a result of stress, and
                                30% of teenagers felt sadness or depression as a result of stress. This is proof that our educational system is placing an inordinate amount of stress on students: if more than a third of high-school students are negatively
                                affected by stress, something is very wrong. In fact, when one starts typing into the Google search engine, “school makes me feel...”, the second autocomplete result is “school makes me feel suicidal”. (The first, by the
                                way, is “school makes me feel stupid”.) This is an absolute atrocity. Not only is the school system making bright young students feel worthless about themselves, but it is also making them hate school, it is making them
                                hate education, and it is making them hate learning. In a generation more scientifically and technologically advanced than any before, where science and technology are more important than ever before, people see the educational
                                system as something evil, determined to crush their happiness and sense of individuality. This is a tragedy. In order for education to be successful, we need to make students embrace education; we need to make students
                                love learning. Unfortunately, our current educational system accomplishes exactly the opposite. If we are to ever make students embrace learning, then we must provide them with a learning environment that promotes creativity
                                and uses inspiration, not fear, to motivate students to succeed. Honestly, can students truly perform to their highest potential when under the severe stress that they face every day in our educational system?</p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>Now, I know that some of you may think that the educational system has been proven to work. But honestly, has the educational system’s effectivity been proven? Has it been proven to teach science adequately? Many people think
                                the Earth is still flat, and the majority of the population does not know what a “chemical” is. Has the educational system been proven to teach mathematics adequately? Our Grade 6 class had to spend a month learning multiplication
                                tables, and in the popular view, mathematics is seen as a terrible and fearsome monster rather than the thing of wonderful beauty that it is. Has the educational system been proven to teach rational skepticism adequately?
                                Look at President-Elect Trump’s campaign, and all the fearmongerers taking advantage of the ignorance of the general populace. But I can tell you what the educational system has been proven to accomplish. Our educational
                                system has been proven to cause stress, anxiety, and depression in students. Our educational system has been proven to make students hate learning. Our educational system has been shown time and time again to be in dire
                                need of improvements. If we want our educational system to adequately prepare students for the 21st century, it is imperative that we improve our science and mathematics curricula; it is imperative that we improve all of
                                our curricula, from physics to history to music; it is imperative that we devote more governmental effort towards education; it is imperative that we reduce the stress that students face on a daily basis; it is imperative
                                that we make students forget their fear of failure and fall in love with learning and education.</p>
